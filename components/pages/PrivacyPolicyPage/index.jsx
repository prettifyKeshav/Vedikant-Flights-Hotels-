                                <h3>Privacy Statement</h3>
                                <p>Flextron Circuit Assembly (FCA) recognizes and respects the privacy of an individual or an entity. We know you want to remain in control of your personal information as well. FCA realizes that earning and retaining your trust is of paramount importance and it’s a responsibility we take very seriously, every day.</p>
                                <p>When browsing our site, you are not required to provide any personal information unless and until you choose to make a purchase or sign up for one of our e-mail newsletters or other services. We do not knowingly permit the site to be used by any person under the age of eighteen and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children (meaning those younger than thirteen years of age). All information collected as a result of an internet registration on our website will be stored in limited-access servers and will be used only for our direct communication with that customer. We will maintain safeguards using SSL secured connections to protect the security of these servers and your personally identifiable information. Our customer list is our valuable asset we protect and secure.</p>
                                <p>FCA may disclose member information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties of FCA or its affiliated companies or when we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. In addition, if FCA or substantially all of its assets are acquired, our customer information will most likely also be transferred in connection with such acquisition.</p>


                                <h3>Your Rights</h3>
                                <p>You have the right to request to modify or to be removed from our active e-mail database list. Send an e-mail asking to update certain personally identifiable information, or to be removed from our active e-mail list.</p>
                                <p>We will comply with your request as soon as reasonably possible. To protect your confidentiality, we can only send the request to the e-mail address listed in our database. We do maintain back-up copies of your personally identifiable information and reserve the right to contact former users of the website from time to time.</p>

                                <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
                                <p>This policy is effective as of July 1, 2005. FCA may change or supplement this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any material changes in the way FCA uses personal information will be described in future versions of this Privacy Policy. When we make any material change to this Privacy Policy, we will inform you by changing the date on this page noting when the policy was last updated.</p>


                                <h3>Use of Cookies and Data Security</h3>
                                <p>We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of the registration process and to personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.

                                <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site’s features that you customized.</p>
                                <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
